# discord-rag-bot

RAG Bot is a simple Discord bot built with Node.js and Discord.js.
It supports two slash commands: /ask to ask questions and /feedback to send feedback.
The bot responds with a mock answer and allows users to react with 👍 or 👎.
You can also mention the bot directly to ask questions.
Feedback and reactions are logged to the console for review.
Easy to set up with a .env file and one node index.js command to start!
